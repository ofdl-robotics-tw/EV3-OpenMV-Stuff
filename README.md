# EV3-OpenMV-Stuff
An OpenMV software, hardware example for LEGO Mindstroms EV3 (support SPIKE/RI).

## How it works
Team ceeoinnovations created a MicroPython library for the LEGO UART Protocol that can be used with OpenMV, and we wtote a sample program to let OpenMV detect objects by color and mark them with IDs on the screen (OpenMV IDE view) and send the largest object information to EV3.
